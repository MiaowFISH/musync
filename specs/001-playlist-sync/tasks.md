### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Can Start After |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| US1 (Login) | Phase 2 | Foundational complete |
| US2 (Playlist) | US1 | User can login |
| US3 (Scan) | Phase 2 | Foundational complete |
| US4 (Diff) | US2, US3 | Playlist + Scan complete |
| US5 (Download) | US4 | Diff complete |
| US6 (Upgrade) | US5 | Download complete |
| US7 (NCM) | US3 | Scan complete |
| US8 (Database) | Phase 2 | Foundational complete |

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 1 (Setup):**
- T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational):**
- T009, T010, T011 can run in parallel after T008

**Independent Stories (after Phase 2):**
- US1 (Login) and US3 (Scan) and US8 (Database) can start in parallel
- US7 (NCM) can develop independently after US3

**Within Each Story:**
- Tasks marked [P] within a story can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 1 Setup

```bash
# All these can run simultaneously:
Task T002: "Install dependencies"
Task T003: "Create project directory structure"
Task T004: "Create constants"
Task T005: "Implement logger"
Task T006: "Implement file utility"
Task T007: "Implement format utility"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-4)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 (Login) → **可以登录**
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 (Playlist) → **可以查看歌单**
5. Complete Phase 5: US3 (Scan) → **可以扫描本地**
6. Complete Phase 6: US4 (Diff) → **可以对比差异**
7. **MVP READY**: 用户可以登录、查看歌单、扫描本地、对比差异

### Incremental Delivery

| Milestone | Stories | Value Delivered |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| MVP | US1-4 | 查看在线与本地差异 |
| v1.0 | +US5 | 下载缺失歌曲 |
| v1.1 | +US6 | 音质升级 |
| v1.2 | +US7 | NCM 解密 |
| v1.3 | +US8 | 完整数据库管理 |

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [US#] label maps task to specific user story
- Each user story should be independently testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- 避免: 模糊任务、同文件冲突、破坏独立性的跨故事依赖
